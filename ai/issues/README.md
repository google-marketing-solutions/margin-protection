# AI Issue Tracking

This directory is used for logging persistent and difficult-to-debug errors encountered by the AI assistant.

Each file in this directory should be a `.csv` file representing a unique, recurring error.

For the complete workflow on how to create and maintain these error logs, please refer to the **Error Tracking Workflow section in the main AI README**.
