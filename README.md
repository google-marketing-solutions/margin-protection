# Launch Monitor

## Status

![Whole Repository Health](https://github.com/google-marketing-solutions/margin-protection/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)

## Overview

This solution helps to automate pre-launch and just-launched checklists for
customers in order to avoid errors or detect them quickly.

New rules can be programmed in as needed in customer-specific implementations.

This space is the home of SA360, DV360+DBM, and other product-specific
launch monitor implementations.

It contains pure Apps Script solutions, as well as TypeScript solutions.

We welcome contributors, feature request ideas, and any other feedback.
