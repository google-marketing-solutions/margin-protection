<h3>Pre-Launch QA</h3>
<p>Before a campaign's flight start date, you can manually run Pre-Launch QA from the top menu
  (<strong>Launch Monitor > Pre-Launch QA</strong>) from the top menu. You will receive a report
  with any actionable items for all campaigns. You can modify the filters to find the details you
  care about. By default, only anomalous values are shown.</p>

<h3>Launch Monitor</h3>
<p>The Launch Monitor runs hourly by default (this is a setting you can control). It will update a
  sheet. Specify "CSV Back-up" under <strong>Launch Monitor Options</strong> if you want to store
  your reports as a CSV automatically. They will be stored in Google Drive under a folder.</p>
